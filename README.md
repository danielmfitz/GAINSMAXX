# GAINSMAXX
A basic program for putting on mass effectively

GAINSMAXX is a project I will iterate on with new stuff I learn about programming as I go along (GUI, new inputs, web inputs maybe? etc). GAINSMAXX intakes your basic stats (weight, height etc) and gives you a weight goal to hit based on the Mifflin St. Jeor TDEE equation and some basic activity level scaling.
