# GAINSMAXX
A basic program for putting on mass effectively

GAINSMAXX is a project I will iterate on with new stuff I learn about programming as I go along (GUI, new inputs, web inputs maybe? etc). 

GAINSMAXX intakes some basic stats stats about yourself (weight, height etc) and gives you a weight goal to hit based on the Mifflin St. Jeor TDEE equation and some basic activity level scaling. GAINSMAXX does not officially support weight loss to encourage making BIG GAINS.

# Ideas for the project:
- Some kind of GUI either through web browser or as a downloadable file
- Further manipulation of variables like activity level to finetune results
- Perhaps adding in more functions such as meal planning, macronutrients, etc
