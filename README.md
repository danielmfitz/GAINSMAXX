# GAINSMAXX
A basic program for putting on mass effectively

GAINSMAXX is a project I will iterate on with new stuff I learn about programming as I go along (GUI, new inputs, web inputs maybe? etc). 

GAINSMAXX intakes some basic stats stats about yourself (weight, height etc) and gives you a weight goal to hit based on the Mifflin St. Jeor TDEE equation and some basic activity level scaling. GAINSMAXX does not officially support weight loss to encourage making BIG GAINS.
